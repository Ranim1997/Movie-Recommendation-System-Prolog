# Movie-Recommendation-System-Prolog
For many years, movies were a way to entertain for a lot of people. Nowadays, the evolution of technologies; movie lovers could find a huge number of movies via multiple movie providers. In order to help movie lovers to save time and effort looking for movies satisfy with their preference; we came up with a Movie Recommendation System. The Movie Recommendation System has the ability to give the user the best match movie based on their preference.


# Analysis and Design
The system has two main users. The first user is the admin, who has the authority to control the
system (display all movies, add, and delete a movie). The second user is a movie love, who can interact
with the system to get a specific recommendation based on his/her preference.
